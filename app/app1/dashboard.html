jhsdkfjsdhiThere's our HTML file. We will use Bootstrap to help with our styling. Notice that we also load up ui-router in addition to loading Angular. UI Router is separate from the Angular core, just like ngRoute is separate.
    When creating a link with UI-Router, you will use ui-sref. The href will be generated from this and you want this to point to a certain stat
    application. These are created in your app.js.gfdfgfhjghgkjhkllhyuyxcxx.
