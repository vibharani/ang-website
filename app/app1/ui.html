    dI am building the front-end app for a REST service, and most of the resources are located at long urls where most of the segments are dynamic based on records created in the app by users. Obviously I won't be able to know or create hardcoded routes for most of these records.

My question I suppose is how to handle urls like this with ui-router:



There is always at least one static, predictable segment in every resource url, and the segments are always in a predictable order.

Do I make abstract states for each segment in the url like:
    
</p>    
</div>
